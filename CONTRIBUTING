# Contributing Guidelines

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Community-Code-of-Conduct. We really appreciate that you are considering contributing!

## Contributing

### Report a Bug

To report a bug, open an issue on GitHub with the label `bug`. Please ensure the bug has not already been reported. **If the bug is a potential security vulnerability, please report using our security policy.**

### Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

To suggest a new section or enhancement, please create an issue on GitHub with the label `feature` or `enhancement` using the available feature request issue template. Please ensure the feature or enhancement has not already been suggested.

### Open a Pull Request

* Fork the repo, create a branch, implement your changes, add any relevant tests, submit a PR when your changes are **tested** and ready for review.

Note: if you'd like to implement a new section, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion about the feature.

We invite you to create and submit translations of the Community Code of Conduct.

### Git Guidelines

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch (within reason), rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR.
* If possible and/or relevant, use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format when writing a commit message, so that changelogs can be automatically generated
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/> and summarised in the next few points:
  * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
  * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
  * Limit the subject line to 67 characters or less.
  * Limit the rest of the commit message to 72 characters or less.
  * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line.
  * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`).
